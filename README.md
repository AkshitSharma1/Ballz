        avoid the falling bricks by moving the ball.

        >It has been developed to reinvent some classic computer games based on
        similar themes such as Disc Us, Knockouts,Cubefield, Taxi Driver, etc.
        The game was created keeping in mind younger and less tech savvy
        audiences. It is an enjoyable game sure to appeal to all age groups.

        >The application is mainly based on the movement of various objects
        within the game window. These movements are both automatic/default and
        user-controlled . For example, the movement of the falling bricks is
        automatic, while the movement of the ball is controlled by the user to
        avoid the falling bricks. To make it seem as if the bricks are falling,
        the y-coordinate of the brick image was constantly decremented by a
        small amount. This gives the illusion of continuous movement. Similarly,
        every time the user pressed the D key, the x-coordinate of the ball was
        incremented and every time the user pressed the A key, the x-coordinate
        of the ball was decremented by a small amount. This makes it seem like
        the objects are actually in motion.</span

        >The game ends when the ball collides with a falling brick. To check
        whether collision has occurred, we compare the coordinates of the ball
        and brick. If they are equal, we say that a collision has occurred and
        that game is over. <br>This game includes a well-implemented debugging functionallity that outputs all the logs to Debug.txt
